# Brown-Pub-AI
[[STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION]] (if anybody finds this README)

It's not better or necessarily worse than SillyTavern, but it's your weird cousin's AI frontend at home... Updates from me randomly. Feel free to copy and make it better.
This is an alternative no-frills frontend webUI for hosting AI locally via Oobabooga-Open WebUI.
#Features
* "Group Chat" with multiple character profiles without the need to branch a chat.
* Auto-save, download, and duplicate chats (for branching chats).
* Web Search
* Edit previous messages within a chat.
* A professional Late 80's/Early 90's aesthetic Japanese PC UI.

#Future Features
* Image and File upload for AI analysis.
* Better and broader API connection (ie. Koboldccp, GPT, etc.)
* Built in extras. (*shh* It's a secret, but funny lol)
* Long Term Memory Function (ie. Lorebook variant, potentially LangChain, etc. we'll see)
